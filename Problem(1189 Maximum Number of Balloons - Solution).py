# Problem 1189:
# Given a string text, you want to use the characters of text to form as many instances of the word "balloon" as possible.
# You can use each character in text at most once. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.


# Solution:
class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfBalloons(self, text: str) -> int:
        count = Counter(text)
        return min(count['b'], count['a'], count['l'] // 2, count['o'] // 2, count['n'])
